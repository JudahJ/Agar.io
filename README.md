#Turtle.io

This project is a simplified recreation of the game Agar.io. It was built using Python turtle graphics. The game supports two-player gameplay, allowing players to compete to grow their player shape by consuming food and each other. It uses OOP; the different classes handle: movement mechanics, collision detection, and growth of the players.

Features:

 1. Two-Player Gameplay
- Player 1 Controlled using arrow keys ('Up', 'Down', 'Left', 'Right').
- Player 2 Controlled using WASD keys ('W', 'A', 'S', 'D').

 2. Food Mechanics
- Randomly generated food blobs across the screen. These blobs have random colors between (pink, orange, purple, brown, yellow, and cyan)
- Players grow in size when they consume food.

 3. Collision Detection
- Players can eat each other if one blob is larger than the other.
- When there is only one player left, the program writes the winner on the screen.



 Gameplay Instructions

1. Run the Python script.
2. Use the following controls to move the players:
   - Player 1: Arrow keys
   - Player 2: WASD keys
3. Navigate the screen to consume green food blobs and grow in size.
4. Avoid getting too close to the other player if they are larger, or chase them if you are larger!
5. The game ends when one player consumes the other, displaying the winner.
